     The shuttle Discovery, already delayed three times by technical problems 
     and bad weather, was grounded again Friday, this time by a potentially 
     dangerous gaseous hydrogen leak in a vent line attached to the ship ºs 
     external tank. The Discovery was initially scheduled to make its 39th 
     and final flight last Monday, bearing fresh supplies and an intelligent 
     robot for the International Space Station. But complications delayed the 
     flight from Monday to Friday,  when the hydrogen leak led NASA to conclude 
     that the shuttle would not be ready to launch before its flight window 
     closed this Monday.

Liverpool sign Andy Carroll from Newcastle

Liverpool have signed striker Andy Carroll from Newcastle for a club record fee of about £35m.

"Andy Carroll has completed his move from Newcastle to Liverpool and has signed a five-and-a-half-year-deal," read a Liverpool statement.

The 22-year-old will wear the number nine shirt vacated by Fernando Torres, who has sealed his move to Chelsea.

Carroll has scored 11 goals in 19 league games this season and made his full England debut in November.

Newcastle confirmed that Carroll's transfer request was "reluctantly accepted" on Monday afternoon, and his move was finalised shortly before the transfer deadline (2300 GMT).

Liverpool have also signed Ajax striker Luis Suarez for a £22.7m fee, but recouped about £50m of their transfer-day spending by selling Fernando Torres to Chelsea.

Academy graduate Carroll played a key role in the Magpies' promotion from the Championship last season and had continued to shine since being handed the club's number nine shirt during the summer.

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew had repeatedly stated that the player was not for sale but the club's owner Mike Ashley and managing director Derek Llambias have tried to bring a financial realism to the club during their time at the helm.

Former Magpies and England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Radio 5 live fans would be "angry and disappointed" that Carroll was sold, but the huge transfer fee would have been difficult to turn down.

"I'm staggered just like the rest of Newcastle fans," said Shearer.

"It's an incredible amount of money, you have to say that, for a guy who's scored - what is it? - 14 goals and had half a season in the Premier League, albeit having done very well and the potential is there.

"He's a very young guy, he's been in trouble once or twice before and that would be the major concern."

"It's all right selling your best player, but not getting anyone in to replace him is staggering.

"People are saying that Liverpool have sold Torres, but they have got two guys in [Luis Suarez and Carroll] for over £50m to replace him. I just hope Newcastle invest some of the £35m in new players at the end of the season.

"He is a huge loss, he has carried Newcastle at times this season. There are not many players like him."
	
Carroll was reported in Tuesday's Daily Star to have sent texts to Steve Wraith, editor of the Toon Talk fanzine, claiming he felt he had being forced out of the club.

And Shearer added: "I wouldn't be surprised if he did not want to leave. I know he handed in a transfer request late in the day but I am not sure he wanted to leave."

Carroll is currently out of action with a torn thigh muscle which has kept him sidelined for the last five games and which prompted his visit to a specialist in Sweden on Friday.

Liverpool also signed Coventry City's England Under-17 midfielder Conor Thomas.

The 17 year-old joins on loan for the rest of the season with a view to a permanent move.

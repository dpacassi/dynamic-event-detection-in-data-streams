U.S. data showed the U.S. economy is facing a troubling mix of higher prices and weak growth.

"Every day that we get another negative macro report -- they can't keep brushing it under the rug and say we are in a soft patch and it's only temporary," said Ken Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New York.

"They tried to play the Greece thing off like it was going to be settled and clearly it's not, so it's all coming back to haunt them."

The day's losses left the S&P 500 within a stone's throw of its 200-day moving average of 1,256.82. If that level is breached, losses would be likely to accelerate.

Declines in insurers' shares outpaced the broader market, with the KBW insurance index .KIX down 3 percent. Allstate (ALL.N) lost 2.5 percent to $29.48.

Energy shares also depressed the market as signs of economic weakness fed worries about demand, sending crude to its lowest level since February. Chevron Corp (CVX.N), down 2.2 percent at $98.41, was the biggest drag on the Dow. TheNYSEArca oil index .XOI slumped 2.5 percent. <O/R>

Profit forecasts from companies, including Nucor Corp (NUE.N), Owens Illinois (OI.N) and Ford (F.N), highlighted concerns about the impact that a lethargic economy could have on earnings.

"It's only adding to the negative mood today, but that also might be a precursor of what is to come," Polcari said.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 178.84 points, or 1.48 percent, to 11,897.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX lost 22.45 points, or 1.74 percent, to 1,265.42. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC slid 47.26 points, or 1.76 percent, to 2,631.46.

The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX jumped 16.8 percent to 21.32 -- its highest level since March 18.

The data confirmed views that the economy is getting weaker even as prices are rising. Those economic worries have been largely behind a 7 percent slide in the S&P 500 since its near three-year high on May 2nd.

The core U.S. Consumer Price Index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose more than expected in May, while the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State manufacturing index unexpectedly shrank in June, falling below zero for the first time since November.

Even with the selling pressure on Wall Street, Pandora Media Inc (P.N) managed a successful debut as investors shrugged off profit concerns for the online radio service. Pandora's stock rose 8.9 percent to $17.42, but was well off its intraday high of $23.75. At its peak, Pandora's stock was up as much as 48.4 percent from its IPO price of $16.

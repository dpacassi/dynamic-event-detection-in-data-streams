Michelle Obama Shows Her Warmer Side on ‘The View’

First, she had to unclench her fist. 

Michelle Obama’s opening move as a guest co-host of “The View” on Wednesday was to joke about the famous bump that she had given her husband the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, and that was described by the Fox News anchor E.D. Hill as a “terrorist fist jab.” Mrs. Obama said she was not really “that hip” and credited her husband’s campaign workers for the gesture. “I got that from the young staff,” she said. “It’s the new high five.”

And in that way, and perhaps only that way, Mrs. Obama looked a little like the wife of her husband’s Republican opponent, Cindy McCain, who also used a co-hosting appearance on “The View” last April to smooth over her campaign kerfuffle.

Recipes posted on the McCain campaign Web site as Mrs. McCain’s family’s favorites turned out to be copied word-for-word from ones by Rachael Ray and others. Mrs. McCain told the show’s hosts that an intern had posted the recipes without permission and been duly punished. “That intern is now, I’m happy to say, at the Betty Crocker boot camp,” she joked.

The amount of scrutiny the two spouses face is not commensurate — Mrs. Obama has endured far more virulent attacks by her critics — but it is somehow symmetrical. Mrs. Obama went on a popular television talk show to combat the notion that she is a little too authentic to be a first lady, while Mrs. McCain did it to undercut the image that she is too fake.

It is a familiar pattern. Democratic candidates’ wives — from Rosalynn Carter and Kitty Dukakis to Hillary Rodham Clinton and Teresa Heinz Kerry — are almost invariably characterized by opponents as too feisty and too outspoken, a little too radical for mainstream America. Betty Ford was an early exception to the Republican rule of bland, self-effacing homemakers; as the Equal Rights Amendment faded as a cause and conservatism made a comeback, Republican spouses became ever more careful to stay three steps behind their men and the times. And some have become so intent that they are accused of playacting.

In this election, the two candidates’ wives could not be more different, but each is haunted by the legacy of a famous predecessor. Mrs. McCain, who is very rich, very thin and exquisitely dressed and carries herself with Bergdorf Goodman hauteur, is not at all like Laura Bush or Barbara Bush; she is a blond version of Nancy Reagan circa 1980.

Early on, Mrs. Obama was likened to Jackie Kennedy for her youth and fashion style, but lately, the strong and assertive African-American career woman is experiencing the kind of antifeminist hazing that Mrs. Clinton endured in the 1992 campaign when she made her “baking cookies” faux pas.

Mrs. Obama distanced herself from that model on “The View,” describing herself as a mother and not mentioning her law career or her views on policy. But she also made a point of framing Mrs. Clinton as a pioneer, asserting that sexism had been an issue in her bid for the presidential nomination and praising her gumption.

“It’s only when women like her take the hits and it’s painful, it’s hurtful, but she’ s taking them so that my girls, when they come along, won’t have to feel it as badly,” Mrs. Obama said.

Her performance on Wednesday was polished and all but flawless — although she did almost slip when she tried to describe her husband’s easygoing personality and said what some in the audience heard as “sweet and pathetic.” As her co-hosts giggled, Mrs. Obama demurred that she had meant “sweet, empathetic.”

And she dealt — once again — with the issue of patriotism, explaining that when she had said during the primary that this was the first time she felt “really proud” of her country, she was referring to the political process, not the nation.

“Of course I am proud of my country,” she said. “Nowhere but in America could my story be possible.”

Mrs. Obama made a point of showing her warmer, more personable side, talking about her working-class parents and the joys of being the mother of two young girls, and even admitting that she serves bacon for breakfast and does not wear pantyhose, but she did not disguise her confident manner or her natural authority. Nor did she ever truly relax. When asked whether the reaction to some of her comments had led her to be more inhibited, Mrs. Obama replied somewhat stiffly, “I think in this media age I have to be cognizant.”

And Mrs. Obama seems very aware of how the news media work. As if to send a veiled message to Mrs. McCain, Mrs. Obama mentioned how grateful she was to Laura Bush, noting that she had sent the first lady a note thanking her for her sympathy after her “first time” remarks backfired.

Mrs. McCain, at the time, had been uncharacteristically outspoken and combative, telling Republican audiences: “ I’m proud of my country. I don’t know about you — if you heard those words earlier — I’m very proud of my country.”

Mrs. Obama said she was taking some cues from Mrs. Bush. “There’s a reason people like her,” Mrs. Obama said. “It’s because she doesn’t, sort of, you know, add fuel to the fire.”

Correction: June 27, 2008
The TV Watch column on June 19, about Michelle Obama’s appearance as a co-host on “The View,” referred incorrectly to her mention of her gratitude to Laura Bush after Mrs. Obama was criticized for saying she was really proud of her country for the first time and Mrs. Bush sympathized with her. Mrs. Obama said that she had sent a note to Mrs. Bush, not that Mrs. Bush had sent a note to her.

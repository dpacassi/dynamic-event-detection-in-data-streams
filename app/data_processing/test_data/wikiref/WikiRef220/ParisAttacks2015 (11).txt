The Expanding Web of Connections Among the Paris Attackers

The French and Belgian authorities have established a growing list of individuals suspected of participating in the Islamic State’s terrorist attacks in Paris on Nov. 13. Of the 10 assailants directly involved in the attacks, one remains at large. 

Connections to the Organizer of the Attacks

Abdelhamid Abaaoud is suspected of being a leader of a branch of the Islamic State in Syria called Katibat al-Battar al Libi, which has its origins in Libya. Bilal Hadfi was in contact through Facebook with members of the branch and is thought to have linked arms with Mr. Abaaoud in Syria.

Ibrahim and Salah Abdeslam, who are brothers, lived near Mr. Abaaoud in Molenbeek, a district in Brussels known as a haven for extremists.

Ismaël Omar Mostefaï had been in contact with Mr. Abaaoud, according to a French official.

Hasna Aitboulahcen, Mr. Abaaoud’s cousin, and Jawad Bendaoud are suspected of helping Mr. Abaaoud find housing in a Paris suburb after the attacks.


The Molenbeek Connection

Abdelhamid Abaaoud and Ibrahim Abdeslam spent time in the same Brussels prison and were friends.

Mr. Abaaoud, the Abdeslam brothers, Hamza Attou and Mohamed Amri spent time together at a neighborhood bar. After the attacks, Salah Abdeslam asked Mr. Attou and Mr. Amri to drive him back to Brussels. Ali O. and Abraimi Lazez, who are also suspected of helping Salah Abdeslam flee after the attacks, also lived in Molenbeek.
Other plots linked to Molenbeek

Amedy Coulibaly, who was involved in the Charlie Hebdo attack, is believed to have bought weapons there.

Mehdi Nemmouche, a Frenchman who targeted Jews at a Brussels museum in 2014, killing four, also bought weapons there.

Ayoub el Khazzani, a Moroccan who tried to attack passengers on a high-speed train between Brussels and Paris in August, is thought to have lived there.




French police raided an apartment early on Nov. 18 in the northern Paris suburb of St.-Denis, a few miles from where the suicide bomb attacks at the Stade de France took place. Three people died, including Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 28-year-old Belgian man who is suspected of planning the Paris attacks, and his 26-year-old cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen. A French prosecutor said Mr. Abaaoud and an unidentified man who died during the raid might have participated in the series of attacks outside four restaurants.

Intelligence officials in both France and the United States had previously said they believed Mr. Abaaoud was in Syria. He has fought for the Islamic State in Syria has been prominently featured in Islamic State propaganda. According to a European official, he was a target of Western airstrikes in Syria as recently as last month.

Mr. Abaaoud has also been linked to several other plots, including a foiled plot in January in eastern Belgium, in which two of his associated died; a plot in April to attack a church in a Paris suburb; and an attack in August aboard a high-speed train heading to Paris.
Raids in French and Belgian Dragnet

On Nov. 19, several police raids were held in the Brussels area, many of them targeting friends and relatives of Bilal Hadfi, one of the stadium bombers. Nine people were detained, and seven have since been released.

The police led 414 raids across France over the three nights early in the week, Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said in a statement on Nov. 18. Sixty people were arrested and detained, and 75 weapons were seized. The statement added that 118 people were put under house arrest.

Two were also arrested and charged in Brussels on Saturday in connection with the attacks.



Molenbeek, well known as a haven for extremists, was also the base for Mr. Abaaoud and Salah and Ibrahim Abdeslam, two brothers connected with the attacks. The three lived close to the district’s main police station and would hang out at a neighborhood bar that was at one time owned by Ibrahim and became known as a local drug den.

Hamza Attou and Mohamed Amri, who were arrested Nov. 17 in connection with the attacks, also hung out at the bar.



Two Brothers Are Linked to the Attacks

The French authorities are investigating the role of two brothers who lived in the Molenbeek neighborhood of Brussels. Ibrahim Abdeslam died in the Paris attacks, and Salah Abdeslam is being sought. The two used to hang out with Mr. Abaaoud at a neighborhood bar.

A third brother, Mohamed, was detained on Nov. 14 but released two days later and is not believed to have been involved.
Salah Abdeslam, 26

The one known fugitive of the attacks, he remains at large despite an intense manhunt that has stretched across France, Belgium and Germany. Officials say one hypothesis is that he dropped off the three suicide bombers at Stade de France.

The morning after the attacks, Mr. Abdeslam and two other men went through a roadside check in Cambrai, France, on the way to Belgium. Later that afternoon in Molenbeek, the car was seized and Mr. Abdeslam’s two companions, Hamza Attou, 21, and Mohamed Amri, 27, were arrested.

Two other men, Ali O., 31, a Frenchman living in Molenbeek, and Abraimi Lazez, 39, a Moroccan living in Molenbeek, have also been arrested after helping Mr. Abdeslam flee, according to the federal prosecutor’s office in Brussels. An arrest warrant was issued Tuesday for Mohamed Abrini, 30, who officials said was seen with Mr. Abdeslam two days before the attacks. The two men were driving a Renault Clio that apparently was used later to drop off the suicide bombers at the soccer stadium.
Ibrahim Abdeslam, 31

Ibrahim Abdeslam died detonating a suicide vest at a cafe during the attacks. He had a history of criminal activity and once stood trial for a petty crime with Mr. Abaaoud, according to sources who received confirmation from the Belgian authorities.


Three Bombers Attacked the Stadium

Three attackers detonated suicide vests outside the Stade de France, where a soccer match between France and Germany was being played.
Gate D Bomber

The first attacker detonated his explosives at 9:20 p.m. on Rue Rimet, near Gate D of the stadium. One other person was killed.

The attacker was carrying a passport for a 25-year-old named Ahmad al-Mohammad from Idlib, Syria. The passport had been used by a man posing as a migrant who passed through the Greek island of Leros on Oct. 3 and Presevo, Serbia, on Oct. 7. The French authorities believe that the passport may have been stolen, and the French police asked the public on Tuesday for help in identifying the man, using a photo from an identity document that was issued in Greece.
Gate H Bomber

The unidentified second attacker at the stadium detonated his explosives at 9:30 p.m. on Rue Rimet, near Gate H of the stadium. No one else was reported killed. Officials reported on Friday that fingerprints matching the bomber were taken at a check for migrants in Greece on Oct. 3. Fingerprints for the Gate D bomber were taken during the same check. On Nov. 22, the French National Police posted on Twitter a picture without a name, and asked anyone who had information on the person to contact the authorities.
Bilal Hadfi, 20

The third attacker, identified as Bilal Hadfi, a 20-year-old French citizen living in Belgium, detonated his explosives at 9:53 p.m. on Rue de la Cokerie, just outside of a McDonald’s restaurant about 300 meters from the stadium. No one else was reported killed.

Mr. Hadfi is thought to have gone to Syria early this year. In June, he posted a call on Facebook to attack the West, saying: “Those dogs are attacking our civilians everywhere. Strike them in their community of pigs so they can’t feel safe again in their own dreams.”


Three Men Attacked the Concert Hall

Three men with assault rifles attacked people during a concert at the Bataclan music hall and rounded up survivors as hostages. Police entered the hall at 12:30 a.m. One attacker’s suicide vest detonated when he was shot by police, while the other two attackers detonated their vests on their own. A total of 89 people were killed at the hall.
Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, 29

One of the concert hall attackers has been identified as Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, a 29-year-old French citizen with a history of criminal activity who was known to the authorities as someone who had radical Islamist beliefs. Six of his relatives were detained by authorities for questioning.

According to an official, he was in contact with Mr. Abaaoud, who is suspected of being an organizer behind the attacks. Mr. Mostefaï reportedly entered Turkey in 2013 but “there is no record of him leaving the country.”
Samy Amimour, 28

Samy Amimour was born in Paris and lived in a suburb, according to the French prosecutor's office. He had been previously charged with terrorist conspiracy, and in December 2014, the French newspaper Le Monde published an article about how his father had traveled to Syria to try to bring him back (he was not named at the time).
Third Attacker

The attackers arrived at the Bataclan in a gray Volkswagen Polo and abandoned the car nearby. The car was rented by Salah Abdeslam in Belgium.


Another Team Attacked Restaurants

Gunmen using Kalashnikov-type assault rifles killed 39 people in three separate shootings outside restaurants in central Paris, leaving behind hundreds of 7.62 mm cartridge cases. A suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside another restaurant in the area.
Gunmen

An unknown number of gunmen in a black Seat Léon attacked three locations between 9:25 p.m. and 9:36 p.m.
Ibrahim Abdeslam, 31

At 9:40 p.m., a suicide bomber identified as Ibrahim Abdeslam, a 31-year-old French citizen living in Belgium, detonated a vest identical to the ones used near the stadium inside a restaurant a mile from the where the last round of restaurant shootings occurred. No one else was reported killed in the explosion. It is unclear if the bomber had been in the car with the gunmen.

Mr. Abdeslam had at one point stood trial for petty crime with Mr. Abaaoud, according to sources who received confirmation from Belgian authorities.
What We Know

A black Seat Léon used as the gunmen’s getaway car was found on Nov. 15 morning in Montreuil, an eastern Paris suburb. The car, which contained three Kalashnikov rifles, was rented in Belgium last week by Ibrahim Abdeslam. Mr. Abaaoud and a third unidentified man are also suspected of participating in the restaurant attacks.

Flight MH370: former Australian defence chief to co-ordinate search

Former Australian defence force chief Angus Houston will co-ordinate international efforts to find the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, ahead of a fresh attempt to locate the aircraft’s debris.

Tony Abbott said Houston, a retired Air Chief Marshal, will head a new joint agency coordination centre, based in Perth, which will oversee the efforts to find the plane.

The agency will help co-ordinate Australian and international efforts to locate the flight, which went missing more than three weeks ago, carrying 239 passengers and crew. While Malaysia is officially responsible for the recovery of the flight, which departed Kuala Lumpur bound for China on 8 March, the proximity of the search area to Australia means operations will be overseen from Perth.

The prime minister said Houston was an “individual of enormous experience and great skill” who would lead an agency that provide a single contact point for families to get relevant information on the search.

“This multi-country search is a powerful example of international cooperation at a time of adversity,” Abbott said.

“Military air crew from Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and the United States are searching for possible debris from MH370.

“They have been conducting these searches over a very large area in challenging conditions, far from the Western Australian coast and in variable weather.”

Abbott confirmed that passenger family members heading to Australia will not have to pay a visa fee.

The search for the remains of the plane has shifted to a different part of the southern Indian ocean, after fresh analysis of satellite data.

Objects already retrieved from the ocean by a Chinese ship off Western Australia are not part of the missing plane, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has confirmed. The objects are likely to be fishing debris or rubbish.

The new search area, 1,900km from Perth, will be scoured on Sunday by a total of 10 aircraft, from Australia, Japan, China, Korea, the US and Malaysia.

A total of eight ships will also be deployed in the search for the plane amid an unfavourable weather forecast.

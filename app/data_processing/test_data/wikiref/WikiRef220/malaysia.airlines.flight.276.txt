MH370 Malaysia Airlines: Anwar Ibrahim says government purposefully concealing information

As the Malaysian government confirms that the MH370 crash was 'an accident', we republish the claims of Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition leader, that Malaysia’s sophisticated radar system would have immediately detected Flight MH370 as it crossed the country’s mainland after changing course 

 Malaysia’s government deliberately concealed information that would help to explain what happened to missing Flight MH370, the country’s opposition leader claimed a month after the plane went missing.

In a wide-ranging interview that cast doubt on the official investigation into the disappearance of the plane, Anwar Ibrahim said the country’s “sophisticated” radar system would have identified it after it changed course and crossed back over Malaysia.

Mr Anwar, who personally knew the pilot of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 that went missing in the early hours of March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, called for an international committee to take over the Malaysian-led operation because “the integrity of the whole nation is at stake”.

He indicated that it was even possible that there was complicity by authorities on the ground in what happened to the plane and the 239 people on board.

On Thursday, Malaysia's government released a statement formally declaring the crash of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 an accident, and its passengers "presumed dead", clearing the way for families to seek compensation payments.

Samsung confirms fatal camera flaw on 'limited number' of Galaxy S5 smartphones

The Samsung Galaxy S5's 16-megapixel camera is one of its best assets, but it's also turned into something of a liability for the company just weeks after launch. Complaints across internet forums have documented a major flaw with the camera on some devices — particularly the Verizon Wireless model — that renders the shooter useless.

According to reports, a "camera failure" error has been randomly popping up for some new owners. There's no obvious cause behind the bug, but once the error is received, the camera hardware becomes permanently disabled. Users have taken afflicted S5 phones back to carrier stores and Samsung's own specialty sections at Best Buy in hopes of bringing the camera back to life, but only a physical exchange for a new device has remedied the problem so far.

Samsung has now confirmed that it's aware of the reports and is actively trying to assist impacted customers. In a statement, a company spokesperson told The Verge, "We have learned that a limited number of Galaxy S5 devices may have an issue that causes 'Camera Failure' pop-up error message." S5 owners with a busted camera are asked to call 1-888-987-4357 to arrange an exchange under Samsung's warranty, or they can visit their respective carrier for a swap. Verizon is also doing its part to spread the message, as seen below. The complaints haven't swelled to a crisis quite yet, so you probably shouldn't let the early hiccup sway you away from Samsung's flagship if you were planning to purchase it.

• Michelle will be on a weeklong education trip to China

• She will be talking with students about their lives in China

• It's not the first time the First lady will be on solo diplomatic trip

WASHINGTON - First lady Michelle Obama is travelling to China later this month on an education themed trip along with her daughters Malia and Sasha and her mother Marian Robinson, the White House has announced.

During the March 19-26 trip, Michelle is also likely to meet with her Chinese counterpart, Peng Liyuan, who is a popular folk singer and the second wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The trip is seen as an attempt to make up for what was seen in China as a slight last year when President Barack Obama met with Xi in California but the First lady did not make the trip, though Peng did.

Michelle in a blog post on the White House website said she planned to visit a university and two high schools in Beijing and Chengdu, and will "be talking with students about their lives in China and telling them about America and the values and traditions we hold dear".

"I'll be focusing in particular on the power and importance of education, both in my own life and in the lives of young people in both of our countries."

She said she would also travel to historic and cultural sites and will share "the stories of the students I meet, as well as the interesting facts I learn about Chinese history and culture" via a daily travel blog and posts on Twitter and Instagram.

In a message to students, she said: "These issues affect every last one of us, so it's critically important that young people like you learn about what's going on not just here in America, but around the world."

It's not the first time the First lady has set out on solo diplomatic visits.

In 2010 she assessed earthquake damage in Haiti. She then travelled to Mexico for meetings on getting youths engaged in important political and economic questions.

In 2011 she traveled to Botswana and South Africa sans spouse.

Eleanor Roosevelt pioneered such trips, as she did with so many other aspects of the modern role of First lady.

Roosevelt was the first presidential wife to travel overseas on her own. As a representative of the Red Cross, she traveled to England and Ireland and US bases throughout the Pacific in World War II.

The Kennedy administration deployed First lady Jacqueline Kennedy to unique effect. Admired throughout the world, she built goodwill for the US in solo trips to Greece and Italy. In 1962 she was officially designated a "goodwill ambassador" for a trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan.

More recently, Laura Bush traveled to the Middle East as First lady to promote breast cancer awareness.

Hillary Clinton made a solo trip to China in 1995 to attend a UN Conference on Women, where she called on the host nation to do more to push progress in gender equality.

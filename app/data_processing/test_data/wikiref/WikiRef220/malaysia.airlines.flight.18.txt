MH370 missing Malaysia Airlines plane: Search might be in wrong spot, investigators say 

THE right engine of the doomed flight MH370 ran out of fuel, followed by the loss of the left engine, sending the commercial jet spiralling into the Indian Ocean with 239 souls on board.

That’s the conclusion investigators have reached, according to a new report that also reveals the current underwater search may be happening in the wrong spot.

An updated flight path analysis released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau sets out how investigators reached the conclusions they have, in regards to the Boeing 777’s final resting place.

But the report is careful to note that analysis is ongoing and that may result in “changes to the prioritisation and location of search activity”.

The Malaysia Airlines plane was carrying 239 people when it disappeared seven months ago on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

The latest report lists the aircraft’s “handshakes” with a satellite communication system and explains how that information was used to refine the final probable location.

“This area (on the seventh arc) does not contain all the possible derived paths (of MH370),” the report notes.

“The ongoing refinement may result in changes to search asset deployment.”

Samsung Galaxy Alpha, S5 Active now in Canada (with video)

I brought Samsung’s new Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy S5 Active smartphones home and put them out on a table to show my daughter.

She picked up Samsung Alpha, barely glancing at the S5 Active, the ruggedized version of the S5.

Flipping it around in her hand, she had hardly turned it on when she announced: “This is the one I’d want.”

And that was probably Samsung’s intent in delivering its most elegant phone yet, a metal-framed device that, at 4.7-inches has the same screen size as Apple’s new iPhone 6 and is considerably smaller than the Galaxy S5, which has a  5.1-inch display. With its best design to date, Samsung is no doubt hoping  to appeal to users who are drawn to form before function.

There’s a market for a range of phones and in this case, the Galaxy Alpha appeared to be the one that would convince my daughter, a university undergrad, to make the shift from Apple to Alpha. And that after she has used an iPhone since the first one was released in Canada.

In an interview, Samsung’s Ken Price said that’s what it’s all about – delivering choice for the consumer.

“Samsung is all about choice and variety for our users and so we have a couple of choices for people to makes as they go into the holiday season,” he said.

Interestingly his teen daughter also prefers the Alpha. Parents of course – if they’re still paying for their kids’ phones – would probably rather they carry the rugged phone.

I’m trying out both the Alpha and the Active and for my active west coast lifestyle, the S5 Active is the answer – delivering all the features of the S5 but in a ruggedized form that will take more of the mishaps of daily life without having to be safeguarded inside an expensive case. I like the feel of the Alpha, both in my hand and in my pocket, but I’d choose the Active because the Alpha is missing some features that I particularly like in the larger phone. And that’s not just screen size – I’d give up some screen real estate for a phone that would easier to carry around.

While the S5 has more features than the Alpha, the latter has the look and feel of a premium phone.

The Alpha is wrapped in a polished aluminum frame, answering a call by critics and fans alike for a phone that’s more than plastic.

However, it still has the plastic back, similar to the S5 but with a useful feature common to all Samsung phones – the back can be removed to change the battery, to add the microSIM (with the Alpha,  a nano SIM) – and in the case of the S5 to expand storage with an microSD card. The Alpha, which comes only in a 32GB version, doesn’t offer the extra storage option, which is too bad. I consider extra storage an important plus and it’s a feature not offered by Apple. Also missing is the IR blaster for controlling your TV.

The Alpha is a skinny 6.7 mm and weighs only 115 grams, making it slightly lighter and thinner than the iPhone 6. At 142mm the S5 is 10 mm taller than the Alpha, its width is 72 mm compared to the Alpha’s 65 mm and the S5 is more than a millimetre thicker at 7.9 mm.

The 1280 x 720 resolution screen would seem a noticeable step down from the 1920 x 1080 full HD of the S5, but looking at the two phones side-by-side it’s not something that would be enough to make you choose one over the other. The S5 has a whopping 432 ppi, (pixels per inch), which seems a lot compared to the 312 ppi of the Alpha. However, the iPhone 6 is 326 PPI, so that’s probably the better comparison.

The Alpha has the same fingerprint sensor as the S5 and it has the heart monitor, a feature that takes advantage of Samsung’s S Health app.

The Alpha isn’t waterproof, disappointing since the S5 is and for the outdoors type – like my ski buddies who pull out their phones wrapped, case and all, in plastic baggies – that’s an important consideration.

Both the S5 and the new Alpha have UHD 4K video at 30 frames per second, although the main camera on the Alpha is 12 megapixels, compared to 16MP for the S5.

 

The S5 and the S5 Active are pretty much the same phone under the cover, except that the Active doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner. Instead it has three physical buttons across the bottom on the front of the phone – likely part of the rugged package. The phones share the same dust and water resistance rating – the S5 and the S5 Active are water resistant up to one metre and for 30 minutes.

It has an active button on the lefthand side that pressed launches the Activity Zone, which includes apps like a barometer, compass, flashlight, stopwatch and other shortcuts. Pressed down and held, it activates the camera.

At $150 with a two-year contract for the Alpha or $700 with no contract, despite having fewer features, its price tag is close to the Galaxy S5, which is $200 with a two-year contract. And for the unlocked version, the price is the same $700.

The iPhone 6 starts $265 with a two-year term for the 16GB version and is $750 unlocked. If Samsung’s trying to attract potential iPhone buyers with the Alpha, maybe it’s comparing the price to the iPhone 6. However, the Alpha isn’t Samsung flagship phone, it just has the flagship price.

The S5 Active is somewhat pricier than the S5, at $250 with a two-year term and $750 with no contract.

The best news for consumers in the smartphone wars is that the choice is growing.

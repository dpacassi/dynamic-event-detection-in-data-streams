Michelle Obama on Campaign, Family

As Barack Obama's campaign for the Democratic nomination stretches beyond Super Tuesday, his wife Michelle spoke with The Wall Street Journal's Monica Langley about the run and the family stresses involved. Below are edited excerpts.

The Wall Street Journal: What don't folks know about you?

Michelle Obama: I'm really funny and fun to be around. I'm very sarcastic &hellip; works wonders in a room when you see the movement in my face or intonation in my voice&hellip; . But sarcasm doesn't translate in print &hellip; [Consequently,] I've cut back on it, because I don't want that to be the story.

WSJ: What do you like least about this presidential run?

Mrs. Obama: What I like least is the gamesmanship of politics &hellip; I don't watch the debates &hellip; I don't mind being in tense situations; I just don't like watching folks in them. I never liked watching my brother's basketball games, either.

WSJ: You famously made your husband quit smoking to get your blessing for his run for president. But do you give him a break when he's under stress?

Michelle Obama: I told him, "Figure out another coping mechanism." Barack is doing the Nicorette gum instead.

WSJ: How are your daughters [Malia, 9 years old, and Sasha, 6] handling their father's presidential run?

Michelle Obama: Malia is starting to ask: "What's the impact? If Dad wins, will I finish my school year?" She's indicated she would have some ambivalence. She said, "I want Daddy to win because I think he would be a great president." But she checked to see if she has permission to be happy if he doesn't win. She asked, "Dad, how will you feel if you don't win?" He said, "I'll be fine." She said, "Good."

WSJ: How do they handle your departures to campaign? On this day, you're hitting events in New York and Connecticut.

Michelle Obama: Malia asked, "Where are you traveling to now, Mom? Try to have a good time." My goal is to keep things as normal as possible for the girls as long as possible ... continuing with the play dates, school, activities.

WSJ: With Mr. Obama traveling almost nonstop, are you doing anything differently with your daughters?

Michelle Obama: Without Barack there in the morning, the girls and I have "snuggle time" in my bed. I turn on the lights and we stay there cuddling &hellip; have deep conversations and talk about what it would be like if we could stay in bed all day but that wouldn't be realistic, we wouldn't learn to read&hellip;

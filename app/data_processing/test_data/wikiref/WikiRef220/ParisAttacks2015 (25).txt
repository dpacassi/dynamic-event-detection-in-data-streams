EU ministers order tighter border checks in response to Paris attacks

French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve says clampdown to take instant effect on temporary basis

European governments have responded to the Paris atrocities by ordering immediate vetting of all EU nationals for potential terrorism or criminal connections, in a new regime of much tighter border controls for the EU’s 26-country free-travel area.

A week after the Paris attacks, an emergency meeting in Brussels of EU interior ministers said all EU citizens entering or leaving the free-travel area, known as Schengen, should undergo “systematic” screening against pan-European databases.

“Member states undertake to implement immediately the necessary systematic and coordinated checks at external borders, including on individuals enjoying the right of free movement [EU citizens],” the meeting decided.

The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said the clampdown on borders would take instant effect on a temporary basis until the European commission came up with changes to the Schengen rules enshrining the new regime as mandatory and obligatory.

Under current Schengen rules, this is impossible, with EU citizens subject to “minimum” identification procedures, which are generally cursory and perfunctory. Ministers are under intense pressure to tighten the system because all of the known Paris attackers were EU nationals, either French or Belgian, who found it relatively easy to travel back and forth to and within Europe without major problems even when they were registered as terrorism suspects in the Schengen ornational databases. “Terrorists are crossing the borders of the European Union,” said Cazeneuve.

The ministers called for “a targeted revision of the Schengen borders code to provide for systematic controls of EU nationals, including the verification of biometric information, against relevant databases at external borders of the Schengen area, making full use of technical solutions in order not to hamper the fluidity of movement”.

Finalising the new borders regime could take months, however, and is likely to run into legislative infighting in Brussels. The European commission has to propose changes to the Schengen rules that would then need to be endorsed by national governments and the European parliament, where opposition and delays are likely. Previous attempts to tighten the borders regime, notably after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in January, petered out.

The commission has not been keen to revise the rules, saying there is no need. The commissioner in charge, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told Friday’s meeting that the changes making thorough vetting of EU nationals mandatory could now be “explored”.

Cazeneuve was emphatic. “Strengthening of controls is indispensable. We’ve been saying this for months. This is why the commission has agreed to table systematic and obligatory checks on all entering the Schengen area, including those [EU citizens] who enjoy freedom of movement,” he said.

Avramopoulos also called for the creation of a new EU intelligence service. This is viewed as a non-starter since the bigger countries in particular jealously guard their operational secrecy and are reluctant to share too much information with EU partners. Cazeneuve said it would take too long to establish and Avramopoulos later climbed down, saying his was “an ideal idea” that had not even been discussed by the meeting.

But the ministers also called for far greater cooperation and pooling of information between national intelligence and security services as this is seen as one of the biggest lacunae in the counter-terrorism efforts. Only five of 28 national intelligence services pool information, the commission said, although some of them will share intelligence among themselves while bypassing EU institutions. The meeting agreed to establish a new European counter-terrorism centre from January.

Officials, diplomats, and governments are warning that Schengen, seen as one of the main achievements of European integration, is at risk of unravelling among a welter of beggar-thy-neighbour policies unless much stricter controls are effected on the zone’s external borders.

The Dutch government has even launched exploratory talks on taking Schengen back to basics, including only five instead of 26 countries – the Benelux countries, plus Germany and Austria.

A priority for the ministers was the rapid agreement on collecting and storing data on all air passengers within Europe. They demanded a deal with the European parliament within a month. The so-called “PNR” – or passenger names records system – has been in the works for years and has been blocked on data privacy grounds by the parliament for the past year. “Not a single EU citizen will understand why the parliament continues blocking this essential tool,” said Cazeneuve, while Luxembourg said it wanted a PNR deal struck within a fortnight.

Theresa May, the British home secretary, said Britain would press ahead with its own national system in any case. The French said the same, as did the Belgians who are also to include high-speed trains in their system.

The governments also said that every one of the hundreds of thousands of migrants currently entering the EU, mainly from Syria and the Middle East, had to be registered, identified and finger-printed at the point of entry into Schengen, usually Greece. This is a gargantuan task and Athens has been resisting help from elsewhere in the EU for months while failing to register the vast majority of new arrivals.

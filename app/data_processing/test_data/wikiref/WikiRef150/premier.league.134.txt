Forty factors fuelling football inflation

1 The First Division play-off game is "probably" the richest club game in the world, worth around £34m to the winners, including parachute payments if the club goes straight back down.

2 In 2001-02, 32 clubs reported operating profits - 15 from the Premiership, 17 from the Football League.

3 The Uefa Champions League is, in effect, the sixth major European League and is worth in the region of £25m to the clubs who reach the semi-finals or final.

4 Teams finishing in the top three of the Premiership and taking part in the Champions League stand to make between £44m to £55m from TV, prize money, gate receipts and other commercial spin-offs.

5 Clubs qualifying for the Uefa Cup after finishing fourth or fifth in the Premiership stand to make around £24m.

6 Premiership clubs who do not compete in Europe and finish outside the top six receive an average of £14m from the BSkyB/ITV broadcasting deal.

7 Over the 10 years of the Premiership, Manchester United registered the highest cumulative profits at £229m, with Tottenham Hotspur in second place with £74m.

8 Premiership clubs have spent around £1bn on stadium redevelopment since the league formed in 1991-92.

10 FA Cup attendances in 2001-02 were up by 8.5 % and Football League Cup gates increased by 12.2%.

11 The Premiership is the strongest league in revenue terms. England's total income rose 21% to reach €1.748bn (£1.2bn) and the Premiership receives more revenue than France and Germany put together.

12 Clubs in the Premiership reported operating profits of £84m, the highest since 1997-98, with 83% of clubs reporting an operating profit.

15 Promotion from the First Division to the Premiership at the end of the 2001-02 season was worth around £16m in extra income for the successful clubs.

16 The average income for a Premiership club was £56.6m. However only seven of the 20 clubs achieved this figure - Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Newcastle United, Chelsea, Leeds United and Arsenal.

17 These seven clubs apart, the average income for the rest of the Premiership dropped to £37m, indicating that a "league within a league" has been formed.

18 The average Premiership club has an income four times greater than its First Division counterpart, which earns around £12.4m. This is likely to increase to six times greater over the next few years.

19 The average income for a Second Division club was £4.3m, and £2.7m for a Third Division club.

20 The cost of relegation from the Premiership to the First Division is around £12m in reduced income.

21 League position and wage bills are closely related. The top five payers in the Premiership also finished in the top five.

23 In 1992-93 the average wage for a Premiership player was £75,000 per year. In 2001-02 the average wage for a Premiership player was £600,000.

24 In 1992-93 the average wage for a First Division player was £50,000 while in 2001-02 it was £200,000. Over the same period, the Second Division average wage went from £20,000 to £70,000 and the Division Three average wage increased from £15,000 in 1992-93 to £42,000 in 2001-02.

27 Spending between Premiership clubs on transfers stood at £93.5m in 2002-03 with an average of £3.2m per transfer.

28 The amount of money filtering down from the Premiership to the Football League via transfers was only £18m.

29 Large amounts of cash continue to leave the English game with clubs buying players from abroad. A net outflow of £190m was recorded, consisting of £159m from the Premiership and £31m from the Football League.

30 The average crowd capacity at a Premiership club's stadium is 37,000.

31 The average price of a ticket for a Premiership game is £25.

32 Football League attendances in 2001-02 stood at 14.7m, up 8.5% on the previous season.

It's official - Tottenham have the worst defence in Premier League history


Tottenham have the worst defensive record in the history of the Premier League. That's official.

The White Hart Lane side are one of seven ever-presents since the top flight changed in 1992.

They have played 595 matches and conceded 809 goals, 19 more than Everton and 122 clear of the next ever-present Aston Villa.

Of the seven who have been in the Premier League every season, Manchester United have the best defensive record with 518 conceded in 595 matches, just ahead of Arsenal on 526 from a game less.

United top the goalscoring charts with 1163 - almost two a game - with Arsenal next on 1001.

Tottenham fail to cancel out their negative goal difference by scoring just 791 but the lowest-placed ever present are Everton on 722.

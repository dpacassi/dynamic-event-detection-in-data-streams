Barclays nets Premier League deal 

Barclays has renewed its sponsorship deal with the FA Premier League in a contract worth £65.8m.

The new deal will take the bank's sponsorship of the Premiership up to 2010, in a three-year extension to Barclays' current contract.

The league, formed in 1992, has had a sponsor since 1993, with Barclays backing it since 2004.

From 2001 until 2004, Barclaycard was the official sponsor and prior to that it was the Carling lager brand.

'Fantastic appeal'

Barclays president Bob Diamond said the deal fitted the firm's expanding international business.

"We all know about the fantastic appeal of the Barclays Premiership in the UK but this sponsorship also fits our international presence and aspirations particularly in Asia and continental Europe," he said.

The deal will also see the bank sponsor the Premier League's official pre-season tournament, the Premier League Asia Trophy.

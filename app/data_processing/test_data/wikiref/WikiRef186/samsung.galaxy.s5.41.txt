Samsung Galaxy S5 Hits 10 Million Sales Mark: Smartphone Beats Galaxy S4 Initial Sales Record By Two Days

The Samsung Galaxy S5 has entered the market on a strong point as reports out of Korea indicate the smartphone has shipped more than 10 million units in 25 days.

At this point, the Galaxy S5 can be considered Samsung’s bestselling smartphone to date, beating out its predecessor the Samsung Galaxy S4, which shipped 10 million units in 27 days. Notably, these figures are not indicative of how many consumers have purchased the Galaxy S5 but rather how many handsets have been shipped to for sale. However, it can be deduced that the amount of Galaxy S5 units that have shipped is correlated with demand for the device.

According to reports in early April, the Samsung Galaxy S5 sold better on its launch day than the Galaxy S4 at several retailers. Samsung Experience stores in the U.K. saw long lines of customers anxious to get their hands on the 2014 flagship. In Paris, the Samsung Experience store sold its entire 800-unit inventory. Additionally, some mobile networks in South Korea released the Galaxy S5 prior to the April 11 global launch date, and reported impressive sales. According to Yonhap News, carrier SK Telecom garnered average daily sales of 7,000 units in its first week of selling the Galaxy S5, which it made available to customers on March 27.

Each Samsung Galaxy device has sold better than its predecessor. Before the Galaxy S4, the Samsung Galaxy S3 shipped 10 million units in 50 days, while it took the Samsung Galaxy S2 five months and the original Samsung Galaxy S seven months to move that much inventory.

As sales go on, the Galaxy S5 probably will continue be compared to previous Galaxy devices. After its strong release, the Galaxy S4 went on to sell 20 million handsets in two months, 30 million handsets in four months and 40 million handsets in five months. The Galaxy S3 has sold approximately 60 million handsets since its 2012 release.

Since these are only preliminary sales figures for the Samsung Galaxy S5 there is no definitive proof that the Galaxy S5 has already outsold the Galaxy S4. According to the Chitika online advertising network, the Samsung Galaxy S5 accounted for 4.3 percent of all North American smartphone traffic in the 25 days since the device’s release. In comparison, the Galaxy S4 accounted for 2 percent of North American smartphone traffic in the same time.

BGR notes that these figures indicate that more Galaxy S5 handsets have been online in the past 25 days, not that more Galaxy S5 handsets were purchased. Galaxy S5 sales figures will have to be studied over the coming months to determine the true impact of the device.

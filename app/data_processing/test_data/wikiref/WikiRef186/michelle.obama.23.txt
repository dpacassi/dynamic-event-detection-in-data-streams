Her plan went awry, but Michelle Obama doesn't mind

Michelle Obama stands off to the side of her husband. It is four days after his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, and Barack Obama, U.S. Senate candidate, is giving yet another speech. As he often does during his speeches, he introduces her, half-jokingly, as his "no-nonsense wife."

They are in Ottawa, the first stop on a post-convention tour that is taking them and their two daughters to 30 counties and 39 cities Downstate over five days.


From the national stage in Boston to backyard fundraisers in small Illinois towns, Michelle Obama, who directs community affairs for the University of Chicago Hospitals, is emerging as the pragmatic, smart woman who not only helps keep her husband's ego in check, but also is there to remind him of what is important. She juggles it all because she always has been a woman with "a plan."

Her own story illustrates, though, that plans are subject to change--and chance.

Always a disciplined and serious student, the former Michelle Robinson followed her plan from early on. It took her to Princeton University, to Harvard Law School, and on to a career at one of Chicago's top law firms. Then she met Barack Obama, a smart, charismatic young lawyer who changed her plans forever.

Michelle was working at Sidley Austin Brown & Wood. Barack, who had just finished his first year at Harvard Law, was a summer associate there, and Michelle, only a few years out of law school herself, was his adviser.

The two had a lot in common, except when it came to this: He wanted to date her. She had other ideas.

"I was more focused on my plan," she says while finishing a decidedly unhurried lunch at La Petite Folie, one of her favorite Hyde Park restaurants. "I had made this proclamation to my mother the summer I met Barack, 'I'm not worrying about dating . . . I'm going to focus on me.'"

Considering him a "friend," who was also "a great guy ... cute, really smart," she tried introducing him to other female friends.

He wasn't interested.

"He wanted to take me out and I didn't know that until he asked me out," she says.

She resisted, telling him, "I'm your adviser. Certainly that's going to look bad. That's just way too predictable. [We are] the only two black people here, and [we're] going to start dating?'

"I'm thinking, `No, that's just tacky,'" she recalls.

Eventually, the planner was persuaded and the date took place.

Now, 12 years of married life later, the ardent, persistent suitor is running to become the junior U.S. senator from Illinois, and the planner, well, she's adjusting to the uncertainties of political life. But, in this instance, she knows, the best-laid plans mean nothing until Election Day.

One way she has been able to manage the shifting sands of politics, she says, "is to know that I have to let go of the plan, which is my nature. And it's driving me crazy, because I don't have a plan. So I have to mentally let go of the plan and [say] `we'll figure it out.'"

Also her nature: a calm, direct manner that comes through whether she's in a crowded meeting hall or sitting alone with her husband. Those who know her say she has always been pragmatic, balanced.

"The poise that you see is genuine," says her older brother Craig Robinson. "She is quite comfortable in all situations."

David Mosena, who hired her to be his deputy chief of staff when he worked for Mayor Richard Daley in the early '90s, says, "She has her feet solidly on the ground, both of them. There's not a bone of superficiality in her. She is the real deal. ... She is very comfortable with herself."

Staying sane

As the countdown to Election Day enters a critical phase, and the prospect of making postelection plans becomes inevitable, Obama makes psychic and emotional space a priority for herself.

She has made a deal with herself: Remain sane.

"I cannot be crazy, because then I'm a crazy mother and I'm an angry wife.

"What I notice about men, all men, is that their order is me, my family, God is in there somewhere, but me is first. And for women, me is fourth, and that's not healthy."

Staying healthy involves working out (at 5 a.m.) four days a week; keeping up with the regular activities of daughters Malia, 6, and Sasha, 3, so they "retain that family bond"; and not missing her Friday afternoon hair and manicure appointments. And, as much as possible, she and her husband still have regular date nights.

Barack Obama knows his wife is making sacrifices as she supports his run for the Senate.

"She's been an enormous help, mainly by just keeping our family focused on family," he says. He also knows she's really not all that impressed with the hype that now surrounds his campaign. Sure, she "cares about her community and her country," he says, but "she's much more concerned with the kind of father I am, or the kind of husband I am than she is with whether I give a nice speech at the convention."

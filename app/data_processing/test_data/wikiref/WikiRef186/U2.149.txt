Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom’ Trailer Features New U2 Song ‘Ordinary Love’ 

A just-released trailer for the movie “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom” has a new soundtrack that features the music of U2.

The coming Weinstein Company biopic, which stars Idris Elba as South African leader Nelson Mandela and Naomie Harris as his wife Winnie, just premiered a new clip that features “Ordinary Love,” a song written especially for the film by U2.

In the trailer, we hear U2 frontman Bono singing a steadily building rocker as we see images from “Mandela.” “All the beauty that’s been lost before wants to find us again,” he sings.

Mandela has inspired many other songs. The Special A.K.A., for example, scored a hit with “Free Nelson Mandela” in the 1980s. And U2 has experience writing about human rights heroes–the band’s song “Pride (In the Name of Love)” was featured on its 1984 album “The Unforgettable Fire.” That song dealt with Martin Luther King, Jr.

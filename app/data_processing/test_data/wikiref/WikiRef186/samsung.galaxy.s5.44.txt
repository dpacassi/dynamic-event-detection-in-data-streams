Samsung profits decline as other OEMs eat its lunch

Sales numbers always show gains for Android as a whole quarter after quarter. The little green robot continues to be unstoppable, and in the past few years that has largely been thanks to Samsung’s domination of the Android device ecosystem. It ruled the high-end with the Galaxy S series and cleaned up at the low end with devices like the Galaxy Ace. The newest numbers show Android still on the rise, but Samsung is faltering as it deals with attacks from both ends of the market. The Korean OEM might have to change to stay on top.

Samsung is reporting its lowest profits in more than two years, which must be concerning to a company used to big growth. So what’s causing Samsung’s woes? Perhaps the most obvious issue is that high-end smartphones are peaking — the market is simply becoming saturated with people who already have smartphones, and most of them aren’t going to spend $700 to get the new Galaxy S every year. No, they’ll just wait until their contract is up for renewal, thank you very much.

It’s not just saturation, though. Samsung is also experiencing competition from top-tier OEMs like it has never seen before. Samsung’s hometown rival LG used to be almost irrelevant in the smartphone market, but phones like the Nexus 5 and G3 have catapulted LG into the spotlight. It’s very much a darling of the Android world among western consumers right now. For HTC’s problems, it’s finally seeing some growth, and the M8 is a beautiful premium device. The Galaxy S5 is a very good phone, but it’s not objectively better than the other flagship devices right now. Add to that Samsung’s continued build quality issues and you have a recipe for trouble.

Perhaps even more vexing for Samsung is the trend in low-cost devices. It’s the flagship devices that get all the attention, but most Android phones are mid-range and low-end devices, many of which are sold in developing markets. Samsung used to dominate here as well, but Chinese OEMs are finding more success at home and abroad. Huawei actually doubled its phone shipments year-over-year, and Lenovo saw big increases in China too. These companies work to deeply integrate services that Chinese consumers can use in a market where Google’s services are unreliable or inaccessible — Samsung isn’t in a position to do that.

The pending acquisition of Motorola by Lenovo is also bad news for Samsung. It gives Lenovo a well-known brand outside of China and access to a lot of technology. The Moto G and Moto E have sold very well in developing markets around the world, and future devices based on that model could move even more units with Lenovo at the helm.

While Samsung is staying outwardly aloof, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a moderate amount of panic inside the company. There are already signs that the OEM is looking to pivot and regain some momentum. The first Tizen smartphone has been postponed indefinitely and the company plans to release an Android phone this year that isn’t made out of plastic, which should help its products feel a bit more premium.

There are rumors of a “Galaxy Alpha” device launching in the next few months. This phone would be a metallic remix of the current Galaxy S5, possibly including a few spec bumps. However, the real test of Samsung’s will to change its fortunes will the the launch of the Galaxy Note 4 later this year. If it’s just another plastic Samsung phone with the same ol’ design, other OEMs might continue to gobble up market share. This could be good for us, though. Competition means more innovation and compelling products.

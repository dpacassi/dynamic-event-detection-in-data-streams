Paris attacks: BBC names Stade de France bomber as M al-Mahmod

The picture of a suicide bomber issued by French police in connection with the Paris attacks is of a man travelling under the name of M al-Mahmod, the BBC understands.

The suspect - the third suicide bomber at the Stade de France according to French police - entered the Greek island of Leros on 3 October.

He was with Ahmad al-Mohammed, a fellow Stade de France attacker.

Islamic State militants killed 130 people in Paris on 13 November.

French police have not named the man in the latest appeal for information.

But the BBC's Ed Thomas has matched the image released by French police with a photo on the arrival papers at Leros.

Our correspondent says the two men bought ferry tickets to leave Leros to continue their journey through Europe with Syrian refugees

French media have reported that nine militants carried out the attacks, and seven died on Friday night.

A huge manhunt has been launched for one of the main suspects at large, Belgium-born French national Salah Abdeslam.

One of the men who drove Abdeslam to Belgium told his lawyer that he was dressed in a "big jacket" and may have had a suicide belt.

The lawyer, Carine Couquelet, told French TV this raised questions, including the possibility that Abdeslam was supposed to blow himself up in Paris but then had second thoughts.

Friends of Abdeslam told ABC News they had spoken to him on Skype and said he was hiding in Brussels and desperately trying to get to Syria.

They said he was caught between European authorities hunting him and IS members who were "watching him" and were unhappy that he had not detonated his suicide belt.

Behind François Hollande’s Snap Decision at Stade de France and the Unfolding Terror in Paris

French president judged it too dangerous to send soccer crowds out where militants might be waiting 

PARIS—When the sound of a suicide bomber detonating an explosive vest rang out across the Stade de France, President François Hollande was in the stadium watching France’s national soccer team take on Germany.

Within minutes, the French leader was given alarming news.

Paris was coming under attack from Islamic State militants, and Mr. Hollande had to decide whether it was safer to evacuate the stadium or keep thousands inside.

Huddling with at least two other VIP fans of Les Bleus—French Football Federation President Noël le Graët and France’s top cop, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve—Mr. Hollande decided to let play go uninterrupted, according to French officials.

That meant French midfielders Lassana Diarra and Antoine Griezmann would continue maneuvering on the pitch while, on the other side of town, the players’ own family members became caught in the line of fire.

But Mr. Hollande judged it was too dangerous to send the crowd scrambling into the streets where other militants might be waiting.

Over a 33-minute period, three teams of militants working in close coordination struck a rock concert and five other sites, tearing through Paris in black cars and leaving at least 129 people dead, including Mr. Diarra’s cousin.

“She was a role model,” Mr. Diarra said in a statement, “a supporter, a big sister.”

The onslaught blindsided a nation that was supposed to be one of the world’s toughest on terrorism. Mr. Hollande had kept the country’s security forces on high alert since the deadly January attacks on Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket, passing new spying legislation that drew comparisons to the Patriot Act for its stringency.

When the attacks started Friday, however, France was caught flat-footed. Mr. Hollande was enjoying the soccer game along with the relatives of people who had died in an unrelated tragedy: the crash of a Germanwings jetliner in the Alps. He was one of the few to leave the stadium during the game.

Before the attacks unfolded, Parisians were busy partaking in a weekly ritual: flocking to the Right Bank of the Seine, where most of the city’s liveliest night spots are located.

Bertrand Gauthier, 41 years old, arrived at the Bataclan concert hall wearing a T-shirt silk-screened with a photo of his sons meeting the lead singer of Eagles of Death Metal, the California band performing at the venue that night. As the band launched into its set, the crowd joined in.


“There were a lot of English speakers who were singing all the songs,” Mr. Gauthier said, “The atmosphere was fantastic.”

A few blocks away, carnage was already unfolding. At 9:25 p.m., a team of militants pulled up to one of Paris’s trendiest night spots in a black Seat hatchback, toting automatic weapons and explosive vests.

Alexis Debreil, 38, was dining with two friends at the hip Cambodian eatery Le Petit Cambodge when a militant dressed in black tossed a firecracker onto a table near him, causing the diners to stand up. The militant opened fire, striking Mr. Debreil in the knee and one of his friends in the hip.

Right across the street, a shooter sprayed a crowd of young people who were sipping beer at Le Carillon. By the time the shooters got back in the hatchback, 15 people were dead, including a woman lying next to Mr. Debreil.

“I stroked her hair and said: ‘Stay with us. Hang in there,’ ” he recalled. “Then she went completely white, and I knew she’d died.”

The Seat would hit three other bars and cafes, killing 24 more people. At their last stop, the Comptoir Voltaire, one militant blew himself up while the hatchback drove off. Police are still searching for whoever was inside the car.

Across town at the Stade de France, the crowd heard a second explosion ring out at 9:30 p.m. Another suicide attacker had detonated his vest at Gate H of the stadium. Play continued as police updated Mr. Hollande and his interior minister on the unfolding crisis.

Convening in a secure stadium skybox, Mr. Hollande and his aides felt “the stadium was the safest place for fans,” said Laura Goutry, a spokeswoman for France’s soccer federation.

One suicide bomber, before detonating his vest, had tried to enter the stadium with a ticket to the game, according to security officials. A police official said authorities suspect the attacker aimed to provoke a stampede out of the stadium, forcing spectators onto the streets where two other attackers would have been lying in ambush.

“The surroundings weren’t yet secured,” Ms. Goutry said.

As halftime approached, authorities quietly put the stadium on lockdown, closing the exits and preventing fans from leaving, Ms. Goutry said. A third suicide bomber blew himself up at a McDonald’s down the street from the stadium without killing anyone else.

Mr. Hollande had another decision to make: whether to continue the game. Players would be kept in the dark about the events transpiring, so that fans wouldn’t wonder if anything had gone wrong. As in many soccer games, the size of the crowd meant cellphone reception would be patchy.

When Les Bleus piled into the locker room at halftime, manager Didier Deschamps and team officials decided not to tell the players what little they knew about “incidents in Paris,” according to Philippe Tournon, spokesman for the French national team, adding that officials believed the inside of the stadium was secure.

“It wasn’t worth alarming the players who would have asked questions we didn’t have answers to,” Mr. Tournon said.

Across town, the sister of Mr. Griezmann, the French midfielder, had been in the dark Bataclan, jamming to the Eagles of Death Metal.

At 9:40, three gunmen clad in explosive vests jumped out of a black VW and stormed the theater, according to witnesses and prosecutors. The band was in the middle of a blaring rendition of its song “Kiss the Devil” that muffled the sound of the initial shots.

Suddenly, the band fled the stage and the lights came on.

Florian Nowak, a 22-year-old French army cadet who was at the concert with his father, saw a tall bearded man in a hooded sweatshirt cutting down concertgoers. “He was shooting continuously,” said Mr. Nowak, who hid backstage, “reloading the gun and shooting again.”

Amid the hail of gunfire, many concertgoers became trapped near the stage while others scrambled toward the exits. A video camera captured people hanging out of third-floor windows as fleeing spectators dragged bodies from the concert hall.

As the body count rose, the gunfire slowed. The killers moved methodically through the hall, executing people on the ground and reloading their weapons. In fluent French, they railed against Mr. Hollande, casting their attack as retaliation for France’s involvement in the U.S.-led air campaign against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, according to witnesses.

SWAT teams took positions outside the historic concert hall as the militants took hostages. Twenty minutes after midnight, police stormed the building, firing at one militant who blew himself up, according to prosecutors. The other two militants followed suit moments later.

When the smoke cleared, 89 people were dead inside the Bataclan, and the venue’s parquet floor had turned red with blood, witnesses said.

Ambulances streamed through the city, ferrying hundreds of wounded people to hospitals. Medical workers were well-prepared. Across Paris, hospitals had been scheduled to run drills on how to respond to attacks like the one that struck Charlie Hebdo, said Patrick Pelloux, an emergency-room doctor who was a first responder to the January assault.

By the early hours of Saturday, Dr. Pelloux was overseeing a situation room that alerted 500 doctors and nurses. When Bataclan victims started pouring in, 60 operating tables were active, more than five times the usual number.

“I saw blood everywhere. It was all over the floor, even in the elevator,” said Johan Robert, a 30-year-old patient who was recovering from a motorcycle accident when victims began streaming into Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière.

Back at Stade de France, the game had ended for more than an hour—France won 2-0—and spectators were allowed to leave, but players were forced to stay. Most players had learned about the attacks as they left the field.

Germany’s team, known as Die Mannschaft, already shaken up by a bomb threat at their hotel Friday morning, was desperate to leave Paris but couldn’t figure out how. They needed a new flight or new hotel. Neither was available.

“You could tell how shocked the players were,” general manager Oliver Bierhoff said.

French officials offered to house the players and coaches at Clairefontaine, the national training center. But Germany’s 100-strong delegation was determined to stick together. The team chose to spend the night at the stadium, laying out mattresses on the floor. Les Bleus stayed too.

In the middle of the night, Germany found a dawn flight to Frankfurt. That was France’s cue to go home. Their bus finally crawled out of the Stade de France at 2:55 a.m., players glued to their phones.

It was then that Mr. Griezmann got some good news: His sister was alive.

“Thank God my sister was able to get out of the Bataclan,” he tweeted.

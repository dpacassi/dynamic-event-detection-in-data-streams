Jarrett, Michelle Obama pushed for gay marriage

President Obama mentioned that he and his wife share the position he announced in support of gay marriage, and Thrush and Budoff Brown dig deeper into who helped him arrive where he did:

    Senior White House officials, speaking to a small group of reporters at a Wednesday background briefing, denied reports that two of Obama’s top political advisers, David Plouffe and David Axelrod, urged Obama to slow-walk the decision for fear of a backlash.

    They say the internal debate ended about three months ago when the president told them he supported gay marriage after weighing the personal, religious and political considerations.

    But there were clearly some in Obama’s inner circle who were more enthusiastic about the decision than others, according to advocates and top Democrats.

    Two of the most consistent advocates for marriage equality were two of the most important women in Obama’s life: his wife Michelle and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett, who has repeatedly told her friends in the LGBT community that Obama was moving in their direction, according to people familiar with those interactions.

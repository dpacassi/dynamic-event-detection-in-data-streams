Paris attacks: Hollande and Obama to intensify anti-IS push

The fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) will dominate talks in Washington shortly as French President Francois Hollande meets US President Barack Obama.

The Paris suicide attacks claimed by IS have prompted the US to issue a worldwide travel alert to its citizens.

President Hollande is meeting other world leaders this week, hoping to forge a stronger alliance against IS.

But Turkey's downing of a Russian jet has fuelled tension over the Syria war.

As Turkey is a Nato member the incident has put a new strain on Russian-Western efforts to neutralise the IS threat in Syria and Iraq.

The US is unlikely to support French efforts to build a Russian-Western military alliance against IS, correspondents say. But there is some military co-ordination with Russia.

France is now sending warplanes from the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, off the Syrian coast, to pound IS targets.

Mr Hollande's search for allies

Russia has also stepped up air raids against anti-government rebels in Syria, since a Russian airliner was blown up over Egypt by suspected IS-linked militants last month.

But Western leaders have urged Russia to focus its raids on IS, not on other groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 

Meanwhile, French police are examining what appears to be a suicide bomb belt dumped on a Paris street following the 13 November attacks that killed 130 people.

It is said to resemble belts used by the attackers and was found in a suburb which a suspect is thought to have passed through after the attacks.

The key suspect, Salah Abdeslam, remains at large and a massive manhunt for him continues.

After the attacks he fled to Belgium, where he and some of the other jihadists were based.

German media reported that there may have been sightings of him in the northern state of North Rhine-Westphalia. but a police operation near the town of Espelkamp is now reportedly over with no arrests made.

The Belgian capital Brussels remains on high alert, with schools and the metro closed, on the fourth day of an unprecedented lockdown.

They are due to reopen on Wednesday, but the highest alert level will continue for at least another week.

Belgian prosecutors say five people have now been charged on suspicion of involvement with the Paris attacks and that a judge has issued a European and international arrest warrant for a man named as Mohamed Abrini, 30.

Two days before the attacks, Abrini was seen driving a car with Salah Abdeslam at a petrol station in Ressons on the motorway to Paris.

The Renault Clio was later used in the attacks, prosecutors say.

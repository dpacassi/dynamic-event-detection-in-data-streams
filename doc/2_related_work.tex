Text based event detection is a diverse field and with increasingly large amounts of available information online a compelling topic for research.
With the popularity of social media a lot of research around event detection has been done on microblogs\cite{microblog_clustering} such as Twitter\cite{twitter_survey}\cite{social_media_survey}.
However this thesis focuses on news articles as the primary data source.
Text based clustering as a technique for event detection has already been explored with different approaches such as using custom methods based on neural networks\cite{text_clustering_topic_detection}
or by using a modified version of DBSCAN to account for its sensitivity for differences in cluster densities\cite{dbscan_martingale}.
Based on the promising results with DBSCAN we want to further explore text clustering using its successor HDBSCAN\cite{McInnes2017} and apply it in an online setting.
Regarding the clustering validation there has already been research into recognising biases of different scoring functions \cite{Wu:2009:ARM:1557019.1557115}
and developing custom scoring functions as a result\cite{gates2017comparing}.

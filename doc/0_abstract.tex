\section*{Abstract}

% Einleitung: definiert die Problematik und begründet die Relevanz der Arbeit.
How can events be recognized in a data streams?
And what is the definition of an event?
Current event recognition procedures define possible events (or event types) statically when the system starts.
However, in data streams, the definition should develop dynamically over time as the data and their focus changes over time.

% Methodische Einordnung der Arbeit: Art, Datenbasis und Ziel der Arbeit.
The first goal of this bachelor thesis is to define what an event is and how events can be recognized from static data.
Depending on the definition, a suitable dataset has to be found and chosen in order to create a system
which is capable of recognizing events.
In the second part, the events should be recognized from a data stream and therefore support dynamic event recognition.

% Vorgehen: informiert exemplarisch über die Untersuchungsanlage.
This work uses news API's as data streams and tries to assign the received news articles to different events.
An event is defined as a list of different news articles writing about the same story.
A possible event could be "Brexit" or an upcoming election.
It's important to keep in mind that new events can and should be created over time.

% Ergebnis: beschreibt die wichtigsten Resultate, Erkenntnisse, offenen Fragen.
Assigning news articles to an event can be done by clustering the news articles.
In order to achieve best possible results, a comparison between different clustering techniques has been completed.
It was revealed that HDBSCAN is a promising candidate for our use case as it delivered the best results.

Unfortunately HDBSCAN was not made for data coming from data streams but this thesis will show
one possible solution on how to deal with this.
This work was able to process up to 20'000 news articles with HDBSCAN.
A possible continuation of this work could try to extend this number to process more data at once.

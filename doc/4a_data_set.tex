\subsection{Data set}

Before any clustering method can be implemented or evaluated,
it is important to rely on the right data set for training and evaluation.

% Todo: Add "Brexit" with a description to our index.
\iffalse
As our goal is to detect events in news data streams, we've looked for data sets containing
news articles and if possible, if they're somehow assigned to a \textit{story}.
A story, for example, could be \textit{Brexit}.
Any new news article writing about \textit{Brexit} would be a new event in this story.
\fi

\subsubsection{Data set candidates}
As our goal is to detect events in data streams, we've evaluated different data sets and
their possibilities to extract events from their data themselves.

The bigger the data set would be, the more interesting it would become for us.
We'd also prefer data with prelabeled events and data sets which still get new data.

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}


% Todo: The first important step is to create a test data set to run the evaluations with and verify them.
% Todo: explain the source and structrue

% raw text
% with entity extraction
% word embeddings?
% Tfidf

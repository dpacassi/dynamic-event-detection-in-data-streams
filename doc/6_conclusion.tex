\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Lessons learned}
% State the 3 biggest lessons learned.
% E.g. HDBSCAN is slightly better than sklearn but way faster.
Todo.

\subsection{Future work}

How can this work be improved further?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Improving space complexity and noise ratio of hdbscan.
    \item Alternatively, use hdbscan as an approximation for the number of clusters and a different clustering algorithm
    for the actual creation of the clusters.
\end{itemize}

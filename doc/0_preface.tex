\section*{Preface}
\label{sec:preface}

The following bachelor thesis \textit{Dynamic Event Detection in Data Streams} was written
as part of our computer science studies at the ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences.

After our lectures on artificial intelligence, we realized that we wanted to deepen our knowledge in this area.
This thesis was the perfect opportunity to increase our expertise on topics such as natural language processing
and cluster analysis.

Special thanks go to our two supervisors, Dr. Andreas Weiler and Prof. Dr. Kurt Stockinger,
for their ongoing and effective support during the writing of this thesis.

We would also like to thank our two lecturers Prof. Dr. Thilo Stadelmann
and Prof. Dr. Mark Cieliebak for their lectures on artificial intelligence.

At last but not least, we would like to thank our fellow students
and the entire ZHAW staff for our great time at ZHAW.

Daniel Milenkovic and David Pacassi Torrico

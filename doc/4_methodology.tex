\section{Methodology}

The methodology consits of three parts, where each part builds upon the results from the previous one.
Initially the test data is created, which will be used for all evaluations.
Once the data is available, we evaluate HDBSCAN and determine the settings,
which lead to optimal results regarding our specific use case.
The final part applies the results obtained from the previous evaluation in an online setting.
